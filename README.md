# Threshold setting and analysis of ddPCR data

What is it?
-
This is a simplified and user friendly algorithm for consistent threshold setting and analysis of ddPCR data.

Requirements
-
Software: 
- R (and RStudio) to run the analysis algorithm
- Quantasoft or QX Manager to generate raw amplitude data of ddPCR readout

How does it work?
-
The algorithm starts by running a single line of code in RStudio that is saved in:
- call_cloudy_batch_process_function_v1_2.R   
but also can be pasted from here:
```
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamitoth/ddPCR-threshold-setting-/main/cloudy_batch_process_function_v1_2.R", encoding="latin1")
```
Run the code in RStudio!
#### It requires to select the folder where the amplitude data are saved and five questions need to be answered in the RSudio console!  
Please note that the amplitude data folder must contain only *.csv files that were generated by the droplet reader. Please, delete empty (failed readout) files before running the script. For more information about data requirements: https://github.com/Gromgorgel/ddPCR

#### What are the questions?
1) Which channel?
   - Select the detection channel from the options (currently either 1 or 2)
2) Which well (default = all)?
   - Select the single well that you want to analyse (e.g. B05) or leave it blank to analyse the entire plate.
3) What is the droplet volume (nL; default = 0.797 nL)?
   - Specify the droplet volume in nL. The default option is 0.797 nL that was experimentally determined for the 'One Step RT PCR Mix'.  
   Other options are:
   - 0.771 nL determined for regular PCR Mix without DUTP
   - 0.834 nL is used for regular PCR Mix (with DUTP)
   - The Biorad default for ALL of their mastermixes is 0.795 nL (as of 07/02/2024)
4) What is the sample volume (µL; default = 5 µL)?
   - Specify the sample volume per well in µL. The default option is 5 µL.
5) What is the dilution factor?
   - Specify the dilution factor. It allows the calculation of the original sample concentration but it is only useful if all of the samples have the same dilution factor.

What kind of digital PCR data can it read and analyse?
-
It can read and analyse raw amplitude data generated by either the Biorad QX200 or QX600 droplet readers.
